title: I assisted the Novum Canticum choir in their concert in the Grote Kerk in Apeldoorn
---

I was asked to assist the <a href="https://www.novumcanticum.nl/">Novum Canticum choir</a> in their performance at the <a href="www.grotekerkapeldoorn.nl">Grote Kerk</a> in Apeldoorn. Their repertoire is a mix of traditional and modern music and I played along with six of their thirtheen songs. I was also given the opportunity to play three solo pieces, showing the classical accordion from three different sides. I played Adi&oacute;s Nonino by Astor Piazzolla, Sonata in D minor by Domenico Scarlatti and Tranquillo by Italian accordion composer Pietro Deiro.

It was a wonderful afternoon in a beautiful venue with a mix of different music styles, different combinations of sounds with accordion, piano, drums and alternating choir casts, and alternating accordion solo pieces. The concert was given as a walk-in in the big church alongside a exhibition of art in the theme of 80 years of peace. The audience was entertained and very much enjoyed the concert.

This was my first time accompanying a choir and I really enjoyed the experience and want to thank Novum Canticum and their conductor Ineke van Jaarsveld for the opportunity.

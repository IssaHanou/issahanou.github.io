As a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.icai.ai/labs/rail-lab-delft">RAIL Lab</a>, I work with the Dutch railway companies <a href="https://www.ns.nl/over-ns">NS</a> and <a href="https://www.prorail.nl/over-ons/wat-doet-prorail">ProRail</a> to look at the logistics involved in maintaining the rolling stock outside the runtimes in the timetable. In my work, I apply AI planning to solve real-world railway operation problems and use insights of these problems to develop new methods for AI planning. Besides planning, I am interested in program synthesis and neuro-symbolic AI. 

Previous to starting my PhD position, I received both my bachelor's and master's degrees from TU Delft. During my studies, I was a TA for several courses within the bachelor's program as well.

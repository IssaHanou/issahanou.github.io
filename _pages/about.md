As a PhD student in the <a href="https://icai.ai/icai-labs/rail/">RAIL Lab</a>, I work with the Dutch railway companies to look at the logistics involved in maintaining the rolling stock outside the runtimes in the timetable. In my work, I combine fields of classical planning, program synthesis, neuro-symbolic programming and probabilistic programming. 

Previous to starting my PhD position, I did both my bachelors and masters degrees at TU Delft. During my studies, I was a TA for several courses within the bachelor's program as well.

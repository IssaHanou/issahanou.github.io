<h3>Biography</h3>
When I was nine years old, I started playing accordion and took lessons with Evert van Amsterdam. After a year, I joined the accordion orchestra conducted by my teacher called Air & Tune. I really enjoyed playing in the orchestra and after three years I also joined the <it>Kennemer Accordeon Groep</it>. At the same time, we also started a chamber ensemble called Accordeonsextet Haarlem with five other members from the orchestra and we played at the <a href="https://novam.net/activiteiten/solisten-en-kamermuziek-concours/uitslagen-solisten-en-kamermuziek-concours/">NOVAM Concours</a> twice, being awarded a third and first prize. 

Since 2011, I have also played many times in the solo track of the NOVAM concours, and have been awarded several prizes. In 2013, I also competed at the Prinses Christina Concours. Over the years, I have attended master classes from Gertie Bruin and Stanislav Jusufovic. 

In 2015, I joined the <a href="https://www.haarlemsaccordeonorkest.nl">Haarlem Accordion Orchestra</a> in which I have since played with a lot of enthousiasm. From 2019-2023, I also played in the <a href="https://www.nsao.nl">Dutch Symphonic Accordion Orchestra</a>.

From 2020-2023, I had lessons from An Raskin at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague while studying Classical Accordion in the Practicum Musicae program. During this time, I also played in a duo with a mezzosoprano and another duo with accordion player <a href="https://www.kaatvanhaverbeke.be">Kaat Vanhaverbeke</a>.

  abstract         = {The Train Unit Shunting Problem concerns the parking of trains outside their scheduled use on so-called shunting yards. This is an NP-hard problem, and the current algorithm used by the Netherlands Railways cannot detect whether an instance is infeasible. So, infeasible instances can cause needlessly long computation times. Therefore, this paper fills the gap by providing novel approaches to determine the feasibility. For this, the Pebble Motion problem is considered which moves pebbles from their starting node to their goal node in the graph, such that no two pebbles occupy a node at the same time. A variant of the Pebble Motion problem is proposed to model the Train Unit Shunting Problem, where train units are represented by pebbles and the arrival and departure of train unit combinations are also included. This paper specifically looks at dead-end track shunting yards, as they can be abstractly represented by trees, such that trains arrive and depart at the root node. Furthermore, trains cannot be reallocated between arrival and departure in the tree, since reallocation in practice is a very costly process as moves need to be performed by a small set of drivers. The conditions for realizing the departure order of trains are studied, and an efficient method to (partially) determine the feasibility of problem instances is given, which can find the minimal number of tracks required to park the trains. Furthermore, a special case with tracks of length two is shown to be polynomially solvable, while another subset of problem instances with tracks of length six or more is demonstrated to be NP-complete.}

  abstract         = {Shunting yards are the locations where trains, which are not included in the train schedule at a certain time, are parked until they are required again. Managing the parking of the trains such that all trains can leave at the desired time is a complicated task, and results in the problem formally known as the Train Unit Shunting Problem (TUSP). This problem is an NP-hard problem, and current algorithms cannot always determine whether an instance is feasible. We analyze a simplified variant of the TUSP, leaving out details from the real-world scenario to study the theoretical conditions for basic scenarios to be feasible. To this extent, we identify essential elements of the TUSP and include these in a modification of the Pebble Motion problem. Based on this Pebble Motion variant, we establish new problems that can be studied to analyze the feasibility of the TUSP. For each of these problems, we examine the complexity and look into different solution approaches.},

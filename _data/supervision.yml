  title: Inferring Robust Plans with a Rail Network Simulator
  abstract: "Over 700 trains in the Netherlands are used daily for passenger transportation. Train operations involve tasks like parking, recombination, cleaning, and maintenance, which take place in shunting yards. The train unit shunting problem (TUSP) is a complex planning problem made more difficult by uncertainties such as delays. Most existing approaches overlook these disturbances and the approaches that consider them incorporate heuristics to enhance the robustness of their solutions to disturbances. This thesis proposes an alternative approach: utilizing probabilistic programming to turn an existing planning algorithm and simulator into a generative model of the TUSP. The model introduces disturbances without the need to modify the planning algorithm or simulator. Through two types of inference, we infer a distribution of robust solutions for the TUSP. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for inferring robust plans in small-scale scenarios."

  abstract: "Due to the increased demand for train travel, train operators are considering increasing their rolling stock. Before achieving this, they must enhance the capacity of their shunting yards. This is attempted by improving methodologies for solving the Train Unit Shunting and Servicing (TUSS) problem. To address the TUSS problem, a planner determines routes on shunting yards for trains, ensuring they visit designated service tracks before parking in a configuration that facilitates a smooth departure. 
  TUSS is a well-studied problem, and various approaches have been proposed. The first approach capable of solving real-world, complete TUSS instances is a local search method introduced by van den Broek et al. In this thesis, we explore an alternative approach using PDDL models. PDDL is the standard language for describing Automated Planning problems. Automated Planning is a well-established field within artificial intelligence, and new, improved algorithms are continually developed to solve PDDL models for problems similar to TUSS.
  In this thesis, we design a detailed model in PDDL and propose several methods to simplify the model so that planning algorithms perform more efficiently compared to the detailed model. When solving simplified models, a post-processing routine is employed to generate detailed shunting plans. The performance of several model-independent PDDL planners was analysed, and the best-performing planner was identified as Temporal FastDownward.
  By analysing plans obtained from experiments, we identified areas for improvement. Based on this knowledge, we developed a new TUSS-specific planner called Train Order Preserving Search (TOPS). TOPS employs a search algorithm with effective pruning of symmetrical states and a custom heuristic that guides the search towards states where the order of trains aligns with the departure order. TOPS significantly outperformed Temporal FastDownward in these experiments."

  abstract: "Automated Planning, also known as Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning is a branch of AI focused on automated decision-making and scheduling. A subproblem within AI Planning is domain-independent planning, where we want to develop methods that are generalizable for solving planning problems in many domains. A popular modelling language for domain-independent planning is PDDL. In PDDL, we model our problems as having some start state and some goal state; these states are defined by the truth-values of a set of defined predicates applied to a set of objects with corresponding types. In this work, we explore the concept of dynamic macro-actions for PDDL, which are macro-actions whose utility are re-evaluated as we solve more problems, and does not require prior training. We find that dynamic macro-actions are a promising method, showing average improvements in the number of nodes explored in the search space of up to 84% depending on the domain."

  abstract: Landmarks in AI planning give the must-reach intermediate goals and have provided significant reductions in planning time. Different algorithms have been developed for extracting landmarks from problem files and using them in a planner. The goal of the project is to implement these different algorithm in the SymbolicPlanners library in Julia to allow for easier use of these landmark algorithms in future research. Each of the sub-projects implements a different landmark algorithm.

  abstract: Given a planning problem formulation, we want to use our planning algorithm to solve the problem, while taking uncertainty into account but not changing the algorithm. We formulate an uncertain factor using a predefined distribution and modeling the probabilistic program. Using importance sampling, we can sample different outcomes of the uncertain factor and find a plan that is robust against all of these outcomes. Three projects focused on a PDDL-written problem (Sokoban, Minecraft, and Keys & Doors), another project considered the real-world Train Unit Shunting Problem, and the other project worked with the real-world Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem.

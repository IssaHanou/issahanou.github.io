Today I gave my very first lecture. This is a new lecture at the TU Delft, and is one of the lectures in the new course Probabilistic AI and Reasoning which is a core first-year masters course in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence MSc program at the TU Delft. Therefore, I newly designed the lecture, based on materials from other colleagues in the planning community. 

It was a great experience to design the lecture from the ground up, starting with the story and writing a set of lecture notes which I then translated to slides. This gave me a good foundation for the story I want to tell. I was able to do some practice runs and am very satisfied with the result for a pretty full lecture hall with probably about 130 interested students.

I'm very excited to get this first experience and thank the rest of the course team for guiding me through the process. 

The slides and lecture notes can be found at the [Education page](/education).

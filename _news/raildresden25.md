Last week, I attended the 11th International Conference on Railway Operations Modeling and Analysis 2025, or RailDresden. I presented [a poster](/assets/pdf/poster_raildresden.pdf) on our ongoing work applying Multi-Agent Pathfinding to Railway Routing and had many interesting discussions about these algorithms and the complexity of the Train Unit Shunting Problem for passenger trains.

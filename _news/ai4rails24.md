I attended the AI4RAILS workshop at the Optimization and Decision Science conference, where I presented our paper "[Replanning in Advance for Instant Delay Recovery in Multi-Agent Applications: Rerouting Trains in a Railway Hub](/publications#Hanou2024replanning)" again and Mathijs presented our joint work on Multi-Agent Path Finding for Train Shunting. It was a very interesting conference and great to meet so many people working on improving railway operations with AI!

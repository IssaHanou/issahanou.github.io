title: I graduated my conservatory study!
---

During my master's degree, I started a parttime degree at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, studying Classical Accordion with An Raskin. Practicum Musicae is a three year program to study at the conservatory besides your 'regular' studies. After two years, I finished my Computer Science master's degree and agreed with my supervisors that I could finish the last year of my conservatory study alongside the first year of my PhD. 

On Friday June 9, 2023 I performed my graduation concert at Amare. It was a wonderful day and I am proud to say that I graduated with a 8.5! With a lot of friends and family in the audience it was an amazing experience. My own orchestra, the <a href="https://www.haarlemsaccordeonorkest.nl">Haarlem Accordion Orchestra</a> was there as well to play Adi&oacute;s Nonino with me.

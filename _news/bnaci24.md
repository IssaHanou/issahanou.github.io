I attended the BNAIC/BeNeLearn conference in Utrecht, where I presented [our paper](/publications) "Replanning in Advance for Instant Delay Recovery in Multi-Agent Applications: Rerouting Trains in a Railway Hub" again and I also presented ongoing work on generalized landmarks with a poster. Great to see some people again from the local community and also meet some new faces!
